    "## Conductance based synapse models\n",
    "Conductance-based synapses, examine the ion flow dynamics under synaptic transmission. \n",
    "Synapses, serving as communication points between neurons, \n",
    "experience conductance changes over time due to neurotransmitter release or pre-synaptic voltage changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "During synaptic activation, the membrane potential experiences a rapid and transient change, leading to excitatory \n",
    "postsynaptic potential (EPSP) or inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP). This is driven by postsynaptic currents (PSCs) \n",
    "triggered by pre-synaptic cell spiking activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neurotransmitters stored in vesicles in the pre-synaptic terminal are released into the synaptic cleft upon \n",
    "action potential invasion. This process, facilitated by calcium ions, triggers the binding of the neurotransmitter \n",
    "to postsynaptic receptors, causing postsynaptic membrane potential changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conductance-based models, post synaptic conductance is impacted by the ion flow across the neuron's membrane. \n",
    "It's determined by the maximum conductance and the proportion of open channels, influenced by various factors \n",
    "including neurotransmitter amount, post-synaptic cell state, and previous synaptic activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conductance-based synapses showcase phenomena like short-term plasticity, facilitation, and depression. \n",
    "They offer detailed insights into synaptic dynamics, including ion channel kinetics and pre- and post-synaptic \n",
    "interactions. They are beneficial for comprehending synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity, and \n",
    "their roles in neural network dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Synaptic conductance can be presented as a product of maximum conductance and open channel probability ($g_s = \\hat{g}_s P$). \n",
    "Open probability can be split into two terms, $P = P_s P_{rel}$, reflecting pre- and post-synaptic activities. $P_s$ \n",
    "represents the probability of postsynaptic channel opening, given neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic terminal. \n",
    "$P_s$ can be considered as the fraction of opened channels due to the transmitter.\n",
    "\n",
    "At central synapses, each synaptic bouton typically contains just a few active release zones. \n",
    "Thus, when an action potential reaches a distinct anatomically recognized synapse, usually no more than one \n",
    "vesicle is released. This implies that the probability of release $P_{rel}$, \n",
    "plays a significant role in determining whether a presynaptic action potential translates into a postsynaptic signal. \n",
    "In vitro studies suggest that the release probability at an individual synapse, both in vertebrates and invertebrates, \n",
    "can vary greatly, typically ranging from 0.1 to 0.9.\n",
    "Remember that the probability statement here is a statement about the probability of release of a single vesicle, which \n",
    "is a mean value over many trials. The probability of release of a single vesicle in reality dictates a stochastic process,\n",
    "where synapse activation is a random event, with potentially many failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a simplified model of a directly activated receptor channel, the transmitter binds to a closed receptor and opens \n",
    "it through a binding reaction, using $k$ transmitter molecules. \n",
    "Conversely, the transmitter molecules unbind from the receptor, causing it to close. \n",
    "These processes mirror the gating of a voltage-dependent channel, and can be represented by the same type of equation to \n",
    "describe how the open probability $P_s$ changes over time:"

    "\n",
    "Shunting inhibition and hyperpolarizing inhibition are two mechanisms of inhibitory neurotransmission in the nervous system.\n",
    "Both types of inhibition make it more difficult for a neuron to generate an action potential, but they do so in different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hyperpolarizing Inhibition:** This type of inhibition occurs when inhibitory neurotransmitters bind to post-synaptic \n",
    "receptors and open potassium or chloride channels. The opening of these channels leads to an influx of negative charges \n",
    "into the neuron, which makes the inside of the neuron more negative or hyperpolarized (further from the action potential \n",
    "threshold). This increases the membrane potential, or difference in electric charge across the cell membrane, making it \n",
    "more difficult for the neuron to reach the threshold required to fire an action potential. \n",
    "This type of inhibition essentially increases the \"difficulty level\" for the neuron to fire.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Shunting Inhibition:** This type of inhibition occurs when inhibitory neurotransmitters bind to post-synaptic \n",
    "receptors and open chloride channels specifically. This creates an inhibitory post-synaptic potential (IPSP) that doesn't \n",
    "necessarily hyperpolarize the cell, but rather stabilizes it at its resting potential. \n",
    "This form of inhibition is often referred to as \"shunting\" because it prevents the neuron from being depolarized \n",
    "(making it less negative and more likely to fire an action potential) by other excitatory inputs. It's as if these \n",
    "inhibitory inputs create a \"shunt\" or bypass circuit that diverts the excitatory currents away, preventing them from \n",
    "causing depolarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, the overall effect is to inhibit the neuron's ability to generate an action potential, \n",
    "but the exact mechanisms and impacts on the neuron's electrical activity are different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Activation of a $GABA_A$ synapse, one of the most common forms of fast inhibition in\n",
    "cortex and associated structures, increases the membrane conductance for chloride ions\n",
    "and has a reversal potential in the neighborhood of many cells' resting potential, thereby\n",
    "implementing a form of shunting inhibition.\n",
    "Shunting produces a nonlinear interaction between shunting inhibition and excitatory input. \n",
