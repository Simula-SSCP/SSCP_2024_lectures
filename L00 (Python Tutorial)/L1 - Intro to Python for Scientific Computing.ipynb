    "This is a short introduction to the Python programming language, and the Jupyter format. This is a school on computational physiology and you will be using programming throughout to implement and solve various mathematical models, analyze the results and produce plots. Today we aim to give you a quick introduction and overview of Python and its syntax. If you are already familiar with Python, this can act as a quick refresher. As the school progresses you will have ample opportunity to use Python to solve various exercises, and get more experience and practice. If you are completely new to Python, don't panic! We will have teaching assistants present to help you along.\n",

If this is all a bit new to you, we recommend you install a distribution specifically meant for scientific programming, so things are configured out of the box.

Jupyter is mainly what you will use in this course, but again, you will use a cloud based version.\n",

    "[*Spyder*](https://www.spyder-ide.org/), and some of the other editors, are technically what we call an IDE (interactive developer environment), meaning it has a lot of added functionality in addition to being just a simple editor.

Which is a tool that allows for combining your (executable) code with traditional text, images, mathematical equations and so on. It has become a very popular way to work with Python scripting, especially so for data science, where data can be explored and presented more interactively while working with the code itself. For your own project work, you can choose whether you want to use Jupyter, or more traditional scripts."

These are not traditional scripts or programs, but rather a combination of rich text, math, figures and code all contained in the same file. You interact with this file through your browser, which enables Jupyter to use HTML and other useful features. In this school you run on a cloud based Jupyter server, meaning the actual Python code isn't run by your machine. If you install and run Jupyter locally on your machine, it will look exactly the same, and you still use your browser to interact with the notebook, but this time the Jupyter server is your own machine.\n",

We have tried to organize the lectures into a folder structure that is hopefully fairly selv-explanatory.\n",

A helpful tool here is to use the `Cell` > `Run all` option from the toolbar,  which will run all cells in order, and load everything into memory. Alternatively you can use the `Kernel` > `Restart and Run All` if you want to completely reset and then run all cells in order.\n",

In our $s(t)$ example, we used a loop and lists to compute many points, but with `NumPy`, we can do this computation directly. First we import it"

    "The first, `zeros`, creates an array full of 0's, not very exicting. The `arange` works much like `range`, but it gives us a numpy array, unlike the normal `range` it can also take in decimals. The final one: `linspace`, stands for \"linear spacing\", and it is used by writing `np.linspace(a, b, n)`, and then it gives $n$ linearily spaced points in the interval $[a, b]$."

    "\n",
    "So far, we have used a lot of functions, for example `print`, `sin`, `np.linspace`, `plt.plot` and so on. All of these are functions we can *call on* to perform specific tasks. Now we will look at how we can define our own functions.\n",

    "The benefit of defining our own function is that we can avoiding the same code many times over. This is more efficient, and easier to fix if something is wrong. It also makes our code more structured and easy to understand, as a function is a form of *abstraction*. If we write a function that performs some given task, we can later on rely on that function while no longer having to think about *exactly* how that task is achived. This is a big benefit, because the human mind is not good at focusing on too many different things at once."

    "We have just walked through how we can break down and solve a ODE using a forward Euler scheme \"manually\". However, when we start on the actual material, we often won't take the time to manually break down the math and implement our own ODE solver, instead we will rely on a pre-made solver. In this case we want to use the function [`scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.html#scipy.integrate.solve_ivp). This shorthand *ivp* stands for \"initial value problem\". \n",

    "* What time points to solve for\n",
    "* Any additional parameters for the ODE\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement the first, the ODE itself, we create a Python function that returns the right hand side of the ODE. Note especially the arguments it takes in, for `solve_ivp` to work, it specifically has to take in the time parameter as the first argument, and the state(s) itself (in our case `u`) as the second argument. Any additional parameters can be added as additional arguments if desired."

    "Note that `solve_ivp` by default uses an adaptive solver that chooses its own time steps, which can give an output that looks a bit rough and jagged. You can force it to use a finer time step by setting the max time step with the argument `max_step`. There are also other ways to change this, you can for example set the error tolerances, for all the possibilities you can see the [official documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.html#scipy.integrate.solve_ivp) for details."
