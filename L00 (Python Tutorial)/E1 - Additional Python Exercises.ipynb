    "\n",
    "These exercises are meant for you to further familiarize you with Python, and give you an opportunity to practice Python coding and the concepts you have been shown. Note that these exercises might be challenging for beginners, so please do not hesitate to collaborate on them, or ask us for advice or help if you get stuck. On the other hand, if you are more experienced, these exercises might be a bit to simple, in which case we recommend going to <a href=\"https://projecteuler.net\">projecteuler.net</a> and solving the first exercises there using Python."

    "**1b)** Redo your computations, but this time, change the units around so that the answer is in number of liters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1c)** The total mass of the earth is approximately $M=5.972\\times 10^{24}$ kg. Compute the average density of the earth in terms of kg per liter. Does your answer seem reasonable?\n",

    "**4d)** Use `plt.plot` to plot $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ into the same plot for $x\\in[-5, 5]$. To plot two curves in the same plot, simply do two `plt.plot` commands before you do `plt.show`.\n",
