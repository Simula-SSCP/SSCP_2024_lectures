    "\n",
    "For a binding reaction to occur at all, the two reacting molecules need to be close enough to each other to interact. At the molecular level, the reactants are not stationary, but move around in a random and chaotic manner called thermal motion. Due to this motion, many meetings between the two reactants will occur. Not every such meetings will result in a binding. Some will, and some will not. But it is clear that the number of bindings that occur in *total* should be proportional to the number of such meetings that occur. Because thermal motion is inherently random, it is very reasonable to assume that the number of meetings will be proportional to the *concentrations* of the reactants. The more molecules you have available, the more meetings will occur. If we use square brackets to denote the concentrations of the reactants, we write\n",

Instead of writing out the word \"rate\" in our mathematical equations, we typically write it out as the derivative of the concentrations themselves.

As concentrations change, the *rate* will change, but the *rate constant* will not.\n",

    "It is worth taking a few minutes to think about the implications of this curve. For one, we have effectively assumed that the amount of oxygen available is an endless resource, so one *might* assume that this would imply over time that all myoglobin molecules would end up saturated with oxygen. But from the binding curve we see that this is *not* the case, even when the oxygen concentrations grow very large, there will be some small ratio of myoglobin that are not oxygenated. This is simply because of rates of the reaction. If all myoglobin were oxyganted, the forward rate of the binding reaction would be zero, but the reverse will be very high - and so it is clear that fractional degree of oxygenation will stabalize at some number below 100%.\n",
    "\n",
    "The curve tells us what number this will be. If there is no oxygen available, no myoglobin can bind oxygen either. As some oxygen is added to the system some myoglobin will start binding it. If the concentration of free oxygen is low, the fractional oxygenation will also be low, regardless of how much oxygen is available *in total*, it is the concentration of oxygen that is important, due to the law of mass action. As the concentration of free oxygen increases, so does the degree of oxygenation. Note especially that when $[{\\rm O}_2] = K_{\\rm d}$, we get $Y=0.5$. In this scenario, the dissociation constant is equal to the point of half-saturation of the system. As the oxygen levels rise higher than this the oxygenation rises slower and slower, and you can see the oxygen concentrations need to be very high for the oxygenation of myoglobin to approach full saturation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we have derived the fractional oxygenation of myoglobin using the law of mass action and the equilibrium equation. This might seem like a very specific example, especially due to our assumption of a constant level of free oxygen. However, all derivations we have done come directly from the law of mass action and are therefore very general. The assumption of a constant amount of free oxygen can also be a good approximation of a system where there is plentiful of one reactant, and comparatively less of the other. At the end of this session we will turn to enzyme kinematics, which will be precisely such a system, with a lot of a reactant compared to a small amount of a given enzyme."

    "Note also that some care should be taken when discussing the dissociation constant $K_{\\rm d}$. In our case, we introduced it as $k_{\\rm -}/k_{\\rm +}$, but for our expression of $Y$ to make sense, notice that $K_{\\rm d}$ has to have units of mol$^{n}$.

This graph is shown below. We see that by going from a Hill coefficient of 1 to 4 makes the function a sigmoidal S-shape with a much steeper rise. The two curves intersect in the half-saturation point (because they have the same $K_{\\rm A}$), but the curve for $n=4$ goes towards zero much faster below this point, and goes to one much faster above it.\n",

Effectively, this means that hemoglobin is much better suited to act as an oxygen carrier, as it can pick up oxygen in the lungs, and deposit this in the muscles. Myoglobin on the other hand, does not act that well as an oxygen carrier, because it struggles to effectively part with its oxygen unless there is very little oxygen present.\n",

The equation is however much more general than this specific example, and can be used to model many types of binding reactions. To emphasize this, let us write it out as a more general equation. In biochemistry, it is common to call the ion or molecule that is being bound the *ligand* and the macromolecule that binds it the *receptor*. A general ligand-receptor binding can then be described with the equation\n",

    "\n",
    "In our example, we showed that the binding curve of hemoglobin has a Hill coefficient of 4, because it binds four oxygen molecules in an all-or-nothing fashion. Recall however, that this was an approximation we made. If you were to measure the actual oxygen binding curve of hemoglobin you would get a result that fits very well to the Hill curve, but with a Hill coefficient of $n=3$ rather than 4. This is because hemoglobin can, and will, bind one, two or three oxygen molecules. Therefore, the Hill coefficient shouldn't be interpreted strictly as the number of units cooperating, but rather the *degree* of cooperativity. In fact, $n$ can even be fractional. Depending on the exact conditions under which you measure the oxygen binding, you'll find a best fit using a coefficient in the range 2.8-3.1. If we interpret the coefficient as a phenomenological parameter trying to catch the degree of cooperativity, using a fractional coefficient to get the best possible fit to measured data makes perfect sense.\n",

    "In general, we can say that $n = 1$ means no cooperativity, i.e., independent binding sites. When we have \n",
    "cooperative binding, we have $n > 1$. Note also that one can have *negative cooperation*, meaning binding to one site inhibits binding to other sites. In such a case we would have a coefficient $n < 1$."

Such analysis can give us a better understanding of what processes will occur spontaneously, of how close they are to equilibrium and other physical limits. A very useful concept here is called *Gibbs Free Energy*, which combines energy and entropy into a single quantity.\n",

Like energy, the entropy of the reactants in a process does not necessarily have to increase, they *can decrease*, but the net entropy of the reactants and their environment combined can only increase. Because of this, the entropy of any isolated system will tend to grow over time and evolve towards some maximum possible entropy.

    "Gibbs energy is known by many names, but many like to use the descriptor *free* energy. When J. W. Gibbs introduced the concept in the 1870s he dubbed it simply *available energy*. This is because the Gibbs energy can be thought of as the maximum amount of work that can be extracted as useful work from a given system. It would be impossible to extract more, without breaking the two laws of thermodynamics.\n",

    "A good metaphor for Gibbs energy is found in Schroeder's *An Introduction to Thermal Physics*. Schroeder asks you to imagine a wizard conjuring up a rabbit from nothing. Obviously, the wizard has to respect the laws of thermodynamics, which state that energy cannot be created, and so he will have to supply the needed energy in the process. But how much energy would the wizard need to supply to create the rabbit? First he has to produce the internal energy of the rabbit itself, $U$, which encompasses all the mass energy and all internal chemical energy and so on. If the rabbit were to be created in a complete vacuum, this would be the end of it. However, to get the rabbit to pop into existence in front of you, the wizard actually has to make space for the rabbit by pushing some air aside, which costs mechanical energy. This cost would be $pV$, the higher the air pressure or the bigger the rabbit, the more work has to be performed. The energy bill is now $U + pV$. However, the wizard is quite clever, and so he can save some energy as well. If he conjures up a cold rabbit, he knows the laws of thermodynamics says heat will spontaneously flow from the high temperature surroundings into the low temperature rabbit, so the wizard can subtract this energy from his energy bill. This contribution is $TS$, where $T$ is the temperature of the surroundings and $S$ is the entropy of the rabbit. Why does the entropy enter into it? Because temperature is defined as the derivative $T = {\\rm d}U/{\\rm d}S$. So the more entropy the rabbit has, the more thermal energy it will absorb from its environment. The total energy bill the wizard needs to pay is therefore the Gibbs energy $U + pV - TS$. \n",

    "Schroeder's analogy nicely illustrates how Gibbs energy combines different thermodynamics considerations into a single quantity. But if the Gibbs energy represents a *cost*, why is it called the *free* energy? The name describes the reverse process. If an evil wizard were to annihilate a rabit and extract as much energy as possible in the process, we would first get the internal energy $U$ and some extra mechanical work from the surrounding air collapsing into the resulting vacuum. However, they would have to dump som of that energy as heat into the environment to satisfy the second law. The Gibbs energy is thus the amount of energy a system could release if it were to cease existing.\n",

In this sense, enzymes can be thought of more as on-buttons for various processes in the cell that are lying in stand-by. An example of this are the energy carrier molecules ATP. These molecules carry a fair bit of chemical energy, and will spontaneously dissocate and release their energy. Luckily, this spontaneous dissociation happens so slowly that ATP is stable enough to be an effective energy carrier. The cell can therefore produce ATP through metabolism and let it float around in the cell for a while, without fear of wasting energy. Throughout the cell are then molecular machines that are equipped with enzymes that speed up the dissocation of ATP, and harness the released energy in the process. Such enzymatic machines are known as the *ATPases*, and we will see several examples of them later in the course.\n",

    "As mentioned, enzymes can work in many different ways. It can actually be challenging to explain precisely why they work. For example, the enzyme *catalase* is common to more or less all life that processes oxygen and is a very well studied organic molecule, but exactly how it works to break down H$_2$O$_2$ still isn't perfectly understood. Therefore, let us not try to understand *how* an enzyme works, but rather how it affects the reaction rate itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model we will look at is called the Michaelis-Menten equation, and it is a direct result of the law of mass action—and in fact it closely resembles the Hill equation as well. While it is a very simple model, it is immensenly useful and sees a lot of use in physiological modeling. It sometimes goes under the name of *first-order kinetics*, as we make a few simplifying assumptions deriving it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model States\n",
    "\n",
    "Enzymes generally work by binding to some molecule, the *substrate*, converting it, and then releasing the *product*. We therefore propose the following reaction to model this activity\n",
    "\n",
    "$${\\rm S} + {\\rm E} \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\overset{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} {\\rm ES} \\overset{k_2}{\\rightarrow} {\\rm E} + {\\rm P}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here S is the substrate that is to be converted and E is the enzyme, these can bind together and form an enzyme-substrate complex, ES. The ES complex can either break up again without converting the substrate, or the substrate can be converted and the complex breaks up into a free enzyme molecule and a product molecule, P. We assume that once the product has been released by the enzyme, it no longer binds to the enzyme spontaneously, so there is no reverse arrow in the final reaction. "

    "#### Reaction rate \n",
    "\n",
    "We are noe modeling a system with three different reactions, so what do we now mean by *reaction rate* in this case? The interesting quantity here is the rate at which the product $P$ is generated, i.e., the time derivative $\\dot{[{\\rm P}]}$. We will call this rate the 'reaction velocity' $v$. Luckily, the law of mass action applies to each concentration separately, so looking at the reaction equation, we can write this out as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$v = \\dot{[{\\rm P}]} = k_2[{\\rm ES}],$$\n",

    "To go further, we will make an assumption that the system will quickly reach an equilibrium where the ratio of bound and unbound enzyme is constant, and so $[{\\rm E}]$ will be constant. If you recall, we mentioned that this is a common assumption that is typically called *quasistatic* conditions. From this assumption we we can set the derivative to zero to get\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that $K_m > 0$, so that $[{\\rm S}]/(K_m + [{\\rm S}])<1$, meaning the reaction velocity can be in the range $[0, v_{\\rm max}]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $[S] = K_m$, we get $v = v_{\\rm max}/2$, thus $K_m$ can be thought of as the point where the enzyme is half-saturated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model we have just derived is known as Michaelis-Menten kinetics. It works very well for a broad range of enzymes. The cases were it might not work that well are cases where we have several different substrates. Single substrate cases are usually assumed to follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, take a note to compare the Michaelis-Menten kinetics with the hill equation. Note how similar these are. In fact, the Michaelis-Menten equation is a special case of the Hill equation where $n=1$, meaning we assume there is no cooperativity involved. That the Michaelis-Menten model gives the exact same expression as our derivation of the Hill equation isn't terribly surprising—but it does tell us that enzyme kinematics exhibit the same saturation behavior as the fractional binding we look at earlier."

    "### Enzyme Inhibition\n",
    "\n",
    "Another class of molecules are the enzyme *inhibitors*. These are molecules that reduce, or completely shut of, the activity of enzymes. There are different functional ways for inhibitors to work, but the simplest mechanism is simply binding to enzyme more readily than the actual substrate, but then not actually converting to anything. Thus the enzymes waste their binding time on the inhibitors rather than the substrate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Enzyme inhibition is another important tool in the cell for regulating behavior, and many drugs are enzyme inhibitors. An example of this is penicillin, which inhibits an enzyme bacteria need for cell wall synthesis, eventually killing the bacteria as it is unable to maintain its own cell wall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extending the Michaelis-Menten model to include enzyme inhibitors is quite easy, we simply add the inhibitor as a new species $I$, and new reactions to the system where the inhibitor can bind to the enzyme. It then turns out we can make slightly different models, depending on where the inhibitor binds. These different models would behave differently in practice. When comparing to experiment, it turns out that the different models correspond to different inhibitors, and so in practice, different enzyme inhibitors are grouped into different classes. The figure below shows how the Michaelis-Menten model would be extended for each of these groups. \n",

Here are four different ways we can incorporate the action of an inhibitor into the Michaelis-Menten model, all of which will have different behaviors. From a general perspective however, these different model extensions are conceptually quite similar and are all based on the law of mass action and the same mathematical framework.</div></center> \n",
    "\n",
    "For each of these cases, we could go through our analysis again, setting up the kinetics from the law of mass action, assume equilibrium and quasi-static conditions, and find expressions for the first-order enzyme kinetics. While we won't go through all the algebra here, the model predictions we end up with agree well with experiment, and are often very useful in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have seen, the Michaelis-Menten model is quite simple, but surprisingly powerful, the fact that it can so easily be extende to include the effects of inhibitors is another reason it is so often used in biomedical modeling."

The goal was to get you in the right mathematical mindset, and to give you an overview and fundament before we start moving to more applied electrophysiology in the coming sessions. For now, let us give you a sneak peak at what is to come in future lectures, and how this ties to what we have covered today.\n",

    "The most important thing we covered in this lecture was the law of mass action. We introduced this as a physical law govering chemical reactions. As mentioned however, the mathematical framework is a lot more general, and can be applied to physical processes as well. An important example of this, with respect to this course, is ion channel gating. A given *ion channel* (more on these soon), can be in either an *open* or a *closed* state. A single cell will a large number of these channels, and so we can create a variable that represents the *ratio* of open or closed channels, and denote these $O$ and $C$. Such that \n",

    "$$C + O = 1$$. \n",

Here we denote them $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. We can then set up the ODE\n",

    "\n",
    "And we can solve this ODE numerically just like our earlier examples. What makes this system a bit more complex than the earlier examples we have shown, is that the on and off rates for ion channels, the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, are typically note static model parameters — but rather full ODE states that vary over time. But you will learn more about that later."
