    "* ${C} = {F}^T{F}$: Right Cauchy-Green tensor. Measure of pure deformation, free og rigid body translation and rotation, often used in constitutive laws. Not technically strain since ${C} = {I}$ for zero discplacement\n",
    "* ${E} = 1/2({F}^T{F}-{I}) = 1/2({C}-{I})$: Green-Lagrange strain. The most commonly used strain tensor for large deformations. Extension of the standard, linear small deformation strain.\n",
    "* ${\\sigma}$: Cauchy stress tensor, also called the true stress. Standard stress tensor used for small deformations. Relevant also for large deformations, but inconvinient to use in computations. \n",
    "* ${P}, {S}$: First and second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensors. Stress tensors suitable for large deformations, since they are defined relative to the undeformed geometry. \n",
    "* $W$: Strain energy function. Defines the elastic energy stored during a deformation. Used to define material laws, since stress is recovered as ${S} = \\partial W/\\partial{E}$, etc.\n"

    "## Example 1: An elastic cube\n",
    "We start with a simple example, where we consider loading of a unit cube. This simple case will illustrate how to define a non-linear elasticity problem in Fenics, and how to introduce boundary conditions and different material properties. The model will be a simple unit cube, fixed at one end ($x=0$) and loaded with a pressure load (negative pressure, i.e. stretch) at the other end ($x=1.0$). The first version of the model will use a simple isotropic neo-Hookean material model. Later we will introduce a more realistic soft tissue model, and also add active contraction. \n"
