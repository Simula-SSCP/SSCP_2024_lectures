    "\n",
    "So far we have modeled how the membrane potential reaches its equilibrium potential as an exponential relaxation. However, in practice, what we want to model are *action potentials*, which are spontaneous spikes in the membrane potential. These action potentials occur because different ion channels in the membrane open and close, changing the equilibrium potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "To properly understand action potentials, we will need to understand when and why ion channels open or close, which is called ion channels *gating*. This is the topic for the next lecture. For now however, let us simply state that sodium channels in the membrane open for a short duration, and see how this would affect the membrane potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us model a membrane with sodium and potassium channels, (no calcium channels this time) so our ODE is\n",
    "$$C_{\\rm m}\\frac{{\\rm d}V}{{\\rm d}t} = -g_{\\rm Na} (V-E_{\\rm Na}) - g_{\\rm K} (V-E_{\\rm K}).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we say, as before, that $g_{\\rm K}$ is constant, i.e., these channels are always open and not gated. The sodium conductance however, is time dependent and equal to \n",
    "$$g_{\\rm Na}(t) = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "0.55 {\\rm\\ µS} & \\mbox{if } 2 {\\rm\\ ms} < t < 2.2 {\\rm\\ ms}, \\\\\n",
    "0.003 {\\rm\\ µS} & \\mbox{else.}\n",
    "\\end{cases}$$\n",
    "This corresponds to the membrane having a large number of sodium channels that are mostly closed, but that open for a short duration, temporarily increasing the sodium conductance."

    "Note that since $g_{\\rm Na}$ now suddenly changes, `solve_ivp` might accidentally jump right over the important time span when a change happens. This is because `solve_ivp` is an adaptive solver which makes larger steps in time when the derivative is small. To work around this, you should use ensure the `max_step` argument is set low enough to capture the change in conductance."

While this is a gross simplification of how sodium channels work, it is actually produces an action potential that is phenomenologically quite correct. At least for neuronal action potentials which last on the order of milliseconds. In cardiac cells, action potentials last for a few hundred milliseconds. You will understand why this is the case better when we get further in the course."
