    "\n",
    "The cell *membrane* is an organelle that surrounds it, and is what separates the inside and the outside of the cell—or the *intracellular* and *extracellular* as we typically call these domains. The structure of the membrane is itself fairly complex, but its most fundamental building blocks are simple. They are molecules known as phospholipids. The most important features of these molecules, shown in Figure 1, is that one side is *hydrophobic* and one side is *hydrophilic*.\n",

    "\n",
    "Hydrophobic, aka non-polar, molecules do not mix well with water and instead tend to separate. Like mixing oil and water. This happens because non-polar molecules disrupt hydrogen bonds between water molecules. This incurs an increase in the Gibbs energy of the system. By clumping together this *hydrophobic interaction* is minimized, which explains why the mixture spontaneously separates to minimize its Gibbs energy. For hydrophilic, or polar, molecules, the situation is reversed. Distributing these evenly throughout the water will increase the entropy of the system, and therefore reduces the net Gibbs energy. Polar molecules therefore spontaneously dissolve into a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phospholipids are *both* hydrophilic and hydrophobic at the same time, so what happens when we try to dissolve them into water? Ideally the heads would dissolve while the tails clump together. Because the two are stuck together they must compromise, and they therefore *self-assemble* into a structure where the hydrophobic tails are shielded from the water while the hydrophilic heads face outward and towards the surrouding water molecules. One such structure is the *lipid bilayer*. In the bilayer, the phospholipids create two planar sheets that lie in parallel, with the tails of each pointing towards the center. The layers do not allow water to pass in, and so the structure very effectively hides the hydrophobic tails away from the water. \n",

    "\n",
    "The bilayer has a fixed thickness, and is very thin, about 5 nm across. However, the sheet itself can grow if more and more phospholipids are added. As the sheet grows it is actually quite flexible, so it can be curved around and meet itself, forming a closed structure, sort of like a balloon. The cell membrane is precisely such a large lipid bilayer that has wrapped around and closed itself. A typical cardiomyocyte is cylindrical and around 100 µm long and about 20 µm in diameter. The membrane itself is thus *extremely thin* compared to the size of the cell. A fun little back of the envelope calculation you can do is compare this to the thickness of the earth's crust, or the skin of an apple—see the following exercise:\n",

    "The molecules of the bilayer self-assemble to minimize their hydrophobic interaction. Note however that there are no *explicit* forces holding these lipids together, and they are more or less free to float and drift in relation to each other as long as they remain within the bilayer planer. The membrane is therefore a dynamic and fluid substance, and it is possible for other molecules to slip in between the lipids and move into or through the membrane. However, the membrane does not treat all molecules equally.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inside of the membrane is a non-polar environment and this means that polar molecules don't want to enter it, as this would incur a significant hydrophobic interaction. Non-polar molecules, such as oxygen or carbon dioxide have little to no issues diffusing through this environment. The conclusion is then that the membrane is permeable to *some* molecules, but impermeable to others.\n",

    "Crucially, all *electrically charged* particles are polar due to their electric charge, and the membrane is therefore highly effective at stopping such charged particles from passing through. And because an electrical current must be carried by a charge carrier, the membrane itself acts like an electrical insulator."

The capacitance of the lipid bilayer is about 1 µF/cm$^2$, where F is the unit of capacitance, Farad. If we multiply this quantity with the full surface of the cell membrane, the whole cell has a capacitance of about 0.05 nF. This might seem like a very small quantity because it is given in terms of nanofarads, however, note that Farad is an absolutely huge unit. Most capacitances seen in electrical components are in the range of pF to µF. Having around 50 pF for the tiny size of the cell means the membrane capacitance is actually fairly high.\n",

These are proteins that span the bilayer and create a *pore* (i.e., a hole) in the membrane through which electrically charged ions can pass through.

Most channels also have the ability to open and close in response to various factors and conditions—this *gating* will be the topic for most of tomorrow.\n",

The actual movement of ions has to occur spontaneously however, driven either by diffusion or an electrical force pushing them through. This is known as *passive* ion transport. The opposite of *passive* transport is then *active* transport, where molecular machinery in the membrane known as *ion pumps* or *exchangers* actively transport ions across the membrane.\n",

The elevator would be more like an ion pump, that *actively* moves people across floors. \n",

This tells us that if $V < E_{\\rm Na}$ there will be a net *influx* of sodium into the cell, and this inward current will shift the membrane potential upwards. If on the other hand $V > E_{\\rm Na}$, sodium will instead be driven to *leave* the cell—this efflux of sodium can happen even if the sodium concentration is much higher inside the cell, because the electric field potential overpowers the diffusive pressure.\n",

In our expression we have used the conductance instead of the resistance, but these are just inverses of each other ($g = 1/R$). It makes sense to use the conductance for the membrane as a component, because if all channels close the conductance goes to 0, while the resistance goes to infinity. It is easier to multiply with 0 mathematically than divide by $\\infty$. The other important factor is that we have replaced the purely electrical potential $V$, with the full electrodiffusive driving force $(V-E_{\\rm Na})$, which comes from the fact that these sodium ions are driven not only by eletrical forces, but also strong diffusive gradients."

It is definitely possible to find a better expression for the current than we have, and to do so would require us to return to the full Nernst-Planck equation, and solve this through the ion channel. This, however, gets complicated real fast, as the potential and concentration change dramatically through the channel, and the Nernst-Planck is a very stiff equation. However, it is possible to make a few simplifying assumptions here as well. The classic model here is to assume that the electric field and concentrations change linearily through the channel (which they don't in reality), and that different ionic species do not affect each other (which they definitely *do* in reality). With these two assumptions one can reduce the Nernst-Planck equation down to a current expression known as the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) current equation. The equation is a lot more complex than the Ohmic expression we will use. We will show it here, but the goal isn't that you will understand it fully (this equation technically gives the current density $\\Phi$ instead of the total current $I$):\n",

They also agree that the current is stronger the further you get from the Nernst equilibrium potential. What they *disagree* on, is how quickly the current changes. While the Ohmic current is linear, the GHK equation is *not*, and is instead *rectified*. This for instance means that the inward and outward currents for a similar absolute distance to the equilibrium potential can be different in magnitude. Figure 7 below shows this in practice for a Potassium current.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Figure 7 clearly shows that the linear, Ohmic current equation is a simplification. It turns out that most modellers in practice think it is good enough in practice. In action potential models with plenty of different ion channels, it is therefore common that most of the actual current expressions in the model are purely Ohmic. If one needs higher accuracy, then one can move to the GHK current equation, which exhibits rectification. It is important to note however that the GHK also isn't completely accurate, as that current is *also* based on several simplifying assumptions.\n",

These currents are *passive* and driven by spontaneous electrodiffusion. From the Nernst-Planck equation we could then derive the *Nernst Potential*, which is the membrane potential at which currents stop and reverse. From this we then introduced Ohmic current expresisons, which are linear approximations to electrodiffusion through open channels.\n",
