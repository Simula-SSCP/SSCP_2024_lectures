    "In the early 20th century a major unanswered in physiology was the basis for neural activation and transmission. Many theories had been proposed but one that held many future truths was Julius Bernstein's \"membrane hypothesis\". It stated that the resting membrane potential, which could be measured, resulted from flow of $\\rm K^{+}$ out of the cell, and that activation involved temporary changes towards the equilibrium of other ions. This came to be known as the \"membrane breakdown hypothesis\" (although that specific terminology was probably a translation error), and those basic ideas drove development of technology that led to our modern understanding of membrane excitation. Here are some key moments and contributors:\n",

    "### Macroscopic (whole-cell) currents are the sum of single channel events ###\n",
    "\n",
    "While the number of ion channels in a single cell varies tremendously depending on the cell's function and size,  large whole-cell currents in excitable cells (e.g. fast Na$^+$ current, or slow K$^+$ current) are often carried by populations of 10's of thousands of ion channels. In many experiments, it is the smooth and continuous overall current carried by these many channels that is measured. This is often termed a macroscopic current to distinguish it from the much smaller and dichotomous (open or closed) current carried by single channels. At any instant in time, the macroscopic current simply reflects the number of open channels and the unitary current conducted by each. Because individual channels respond probabilistically (stochastically) to stimuli that cause them to open and close, it is important to define a framework for relating single channel events to the behaviour of the population, and thus to the macroscopic current. A simple starting point is to define the macroscopic current ($I$) as:\n",

    "(1)                     $I = NiP_o$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $N$ is the number of channels of a particular type, $i$ is the mean single channel (unitary) current, and $P_o$ is the mean open probability of the channels. In most cases $P_o$ and $i$ will be functions of (at least) membrane potential and time, but can be subject to any stimulus that modifies channel gating (opening or closing) or the current that passes through an open channel. This section of the course explores how we use experimental data to build functions for $P_o$ that reflect the underlying biophysics of individual channels, and the macroscopic properties an ensemble of channels. We begin at the single channel level.\n",

    "### Distilling ion channel function from single channel recordings ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course there are many aspects of ion channel behaviour that are worth knowing beyond whether they are simply open or closed. We might ask how a mutation or drug impacts the duration of channel openings, duration of closures, or changes in the unitary current. Some of these properties can be inferred from macroscopic recordings, but because the simultaneous activity of many channels tends to smooth out more subtle differences single channel behaviour many single channel effects become indistinguishable in macroscopic recordings. Still, how do we observe these characteristics in single channel datasets?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applying statistical models to define the structure of single channel function  ####\n",
    "Typical single channel datasets are made up of hundreds to thousands of channel openings and closures. These events represent the end result of all processes that permit a channel to open, and all the processes that result in its closure. Each opening event also exhibits a measurable amplitude, and sometimes multiple amplitudes are observable even for a single channel (thus indicating subconductance states of an open channel). How do we distinguish and define these different states (for amplitude) and processes (for opening and closing)? For this we must rely on statistical models.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Unitary current amplitude #####\n",
    "Thermal noise can influence mean amplitude measured during any opening event. Consider an event that lasts 2 ms and is sampled at 10 kHz, 20 data points will contribute to its mean amplitude. Thus, high frequency noise that overlaps with the event can easily modify the mean of those 20 data. In part for this reason, and because thermal noise is Gaussian distributed, single channel unitary currents are Gaussian distributed. Thus, Gaussian functions are used to fit the event frequency distribution (histogram, Figure 5) to arrive at the mean unitary current amplitude. In cases where a single Gaussian fit is clearly not perfect (see Figure 5) it may be that additional components are necessary to reproduce the observed data. In this case (as in essentially all single channel fitting), a maximum likelihood criterion is used to determine whether any additional components significantly improve the fit. We'll discuss this criterion more later and in detail during the lectures.\n",

    "##### Open and closed dwell times #####\n",
    "Distinct from the amplitude distributions (but as you may recall from your theoretical discussions of single channel gating in lecture 4), the distribution of a dwell time for any single step kinetic process is exponential in time. That is:\n",

As an example, if $\\lambda{}$ is the transition rate from closed to open for a simple one-step opening process, then eqn (2) will describe the entire closed dwell time distribution for the channel, which is depicted in Figure 6 for $\\lambda{} = 1$. You may also recall that the mean closed dwell time ($\\tau{}$) is equal to the reciprocal of the transition rate for this process i.e. $\\tau{} = 1/\\lambda{}$.   \n",

    "\n",
    "In the case that there are multiple processes with characteristic rates (or multi-step processes with equivalent rates) that lead to opening of the channel (this is true for most ion channels), there will be multiple components of the closed dwell time distribution. An analogous case is true for the open dwell-time distribution - multiple processes or multiple steps in a process, will yield a dwell-time distribution with multiple exponential components. Most channels exhibit this complexity, and it often reflects the sequential activation of multiple subunits in $K^+$ channels, or the multiple voltage sensors in $Na^+$ and $Ca^{2+}$ channels.\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Statistically discriminating the structure of ion channel function #####\n",
    "Because there is generally considerable overlap in the multiple components of either an amplitude (Gaussian) or dwell-time (exponential) distribution, it becomes important to use rigorous statistical models to determine how many components are justified by the data. Conventionally, this is performed by applying a maximum-likelihood criterion to the event observations (either the event amplitudes, or event durations).\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how we calculate the maximum likelihood. It first helps to understand how to calculate the likelihood of a particular value for $\\lambda{}$, given a set of observed events. Likelihood is related to the more conventional measure of probability, but not exactly the same, technically it is a conditional probability (in fact, a posterior conditional probability). Concretely, the likelihood that $\\lambda{} = 1$ given a single observed closed event of 1.9 ms duration is the probability of observing that event duration, given $\\lambda{} = 1$, and that is precisely equal to the value of the $\\lambda{}=1$ pdf (Figure 6), at t = 1.9 ms:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the full set of (closed) event durations ($\\vec{t}= [t_1,t_2,...,t_n]$) from a single channel recording, the likelihood of some value of $\\lambda{}$ becomes:\n",

    "\n",
    "With this equation (4) we have an objective function for calculating the likelihoods of candidate values of the $\\lambda{}$ parameter, and now just need to find the value of $\\lambda{}$ that best fits the data, thus maximizing the likelihood. There are a number of ways to perform that optimization, but a common one is to assume that the problem is convex, so that the maximum can be reliably approached by a gradient-based method. Then the highest likelihood should be approached when:\n",

    "\n",
    "To make maximization of this function easier it is typical to first take the natural log of the likelihood function (equation 4), before differentiating. This makes thigns easier because both the natural log and the original function will have the same maximum point with respect to $\\lambda{}$, and the log function is typically more easily differentiated. I highlight this detail because you will most often read or hear about log likelihood estimators, and it is useful to understand how this is related to the original likelihhod function. In this case the log likelihood function is:\n",

    "##### What does this fitting process tell us about the structure of a channel model? #####\n",
    "These processes for fitting single channel dwell-time and amplitude data determine the number of statistically distinguishable dwell-times and amplitudes that exist in those data, and the mean values (mean $\\tau{}$'s, and mean amplitudes) and the relative weighting of each component. This is helpful in characterizing channel function, and gives hints about how a Markov model of channel function should best be structured, but it does not provide a direct set of instructions for defining that structure. More complex approaches have been developed to address those questions, which remain open, but those approaches are slightly beyond the scope of this course. For those interested in a more comprehensive treatment of the topic, check out: Qin, F. (2007). Principles of Single-Channel Kinetic Analysis. In: Molnar, P., Hickman, J.J. (eds) Patch-Clamp Methods and Protocols. Methods in Molecular Biology, vol 403}.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What does this fitting process tell us about the transition rates of a model? #####\n",
    "For relatively simple single channel gating dynamics it can be possible to apply transition rates taken directly from experimental data. For example, a channel with only one kinetic component each for the open and closed durations, and a single conductance state (e.g. Figure 6). In this case (assuming a two-state model structure) the mean open times of those components define the value of the time constant ($\\tau$) for each of the two processes, and you may recall from above that $\\tau{} = 1/\\lambda{}$. Thus, the transition rate for departure from each state can be taken from the analysis. For channels with multiple components to any of the distributions, this inference becomes much more muddy because it is implicit that the processes leading to either opening or closure can be sequential or independent. Furthermore, they may be cooperative (and often are) even if they are not strictly sequential. Thus, defining the transition rates for more complex model structures starting only from single channel data is a considerable challens. As is described below, these types of modeling efforts commonly involve additional data sources such as whole cell recordings.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Are any characteristics of ion channel function unmeasurable via single channel recordings #####\n",
    "In principal, any modulatory influence that alters the conductance or kinetics of an ion channel can be measured via single channel recordings. However, in practice these recordings are very challenging and much more time-consuming than whole-cell recordings. Thus, they generally don't permit the breadth of characterization of ensemble (macroscopic) methods. In general, they are most valuable when a new channel species is being described, or in circumstances when specific kinetic mechanisms are thought to be important. This occurs frequently in pharmacological studies, and in circumstances where the true P$_o$ of the channel is poorly constrained by whole-cell measurements where multiple processes are occurring simultaneously in many thousands of channels. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is common now for many modellers to use some relatively sparse single channel descriptions of function to constrain the structures of their models, but then reparameterize or augment the models to fit other sources of data, particularly whole-cell recordings. We move into discussing those types of recordings next, but it is important to recognize the value of detailed single channel analyses here. They have been essential for many insights to both the basic biophysics and pharmacology of ion channels and electrically excitable tissues. \n"

In this case the holding potential (now often called the conditioning potential) is varied with each iteration, and a subsequent test pulse is used to open the remaining available channels.\n",

Assuming a three-state channel ($C,O,I$) with HH-type $m$ and $h$ processes, this leaves some fraction ($1-m-h$) in the closed state, and available to open during the test pulse. As is the case for steady-state activation it is common to use the voltage at half-maximal availability from a Boltzmann fit as a key parameter in model fitting. At least this is true for HH-type models where there isn't the complexity of decomposing the Boltzmann fit into the multiple transitions in many Markov models. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recovery from inactivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The frequency-dependence of many electrophysiologic processes is closely linked to how quickly, or not, channels of different species recover from their inactivated states. In the heart this is particularly important for transmural and species differences. It is also key for differentiating the fast and slow components of delayed rectifier potassium current and the fast and slow components of the transient outward current. The protocol for characterizing recovery from inactivation involves a simple sequence of paired test pulses at the potential which elicits maximal current in a steady-state activation protocol. The time-interval separating these pulses then serves as the basis for understanding the fraction of channels that have returned from their inactived states to the closed state, and are therefore ready to be activated again. In most cases, channels with multiple kinetic components of recovery there are generally thought to be mulitple inactivated states, as is true for the major cardiac sodium channel (NaV1.5) for which 3-inactivated states are incorporated in modern Markov models.

In this case activation is often measured during repolarization. We will discuss this further with respect to hERG and in lecture.
